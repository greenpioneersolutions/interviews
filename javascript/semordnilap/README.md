## What is Semordnilap

Semordnilap (palindromes spelled backward) is a name coined for words that spell a different word in reverse. The word was coined by Martin Gardner in his notes to C.C. Bombaugh's book Oddities and Curiosities of Words and Literature.[3]

An example of this is the word repaid, which is diaper spelled backward.

The longest examples of a semordnilap contain eight letters:

"stressed" ("desserts")
"rewarder" ("redrawer", one who redraws)
"dioramas" ("samaroid", resembling a samara)
Shorter examples are "deliver" ("reviled"), Zeus ("Suez"), and "swap" ("paws").
